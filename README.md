# scHiCyclePred

A deep learning framework for predicting cell cycles from single-cell Hi-C data using multi-scale interaction information.



## Framework
The general framework of scHiCyclePred is as follows：
<img src="final_framework.jpg"  />  
(a) The extraction of multiple feature sets. scHiCyclePred combines read pair locus mapping file and chromatin interaction pair file to generate a unique chromosome contact matrices for each chromosome in every cell. To enhance cell cycle prediction accuracy and reveal variations in three-dimensional structure across different cell cycles, we extract features representing chromosome three-dimensional structure from diverse perspectives. Specifically, we extract three feature sets: contact probability distribution versus genomic distance (CDD), bin contact probability (BCP), and small intra-domain contact probability (SICP).

(b) CNN model based on multi-feature fusion. We develop a deep learning model that combines convolution and feature fusion modules to accurately predict cell cycle phases.

(c)  The usage of scHiCyclePred. Directly apply the trained model to predict the cell data with unknown cell cycles.

## Usage

You should run this program in the following order :

1. Data_Preparation : Firstly, you should run `fend_map_coord.py` in folder `Data_Preparation` and then `fend_to_bin.py` by the executing the following command line codes in order:
```
python .\Data_Preparation\fend_map_coord.py
```
```
python .\Data_Preparation\fend_to_bin.py
```
 The purpose of this step is to pre-process the raw data.

2. Feature_sets_extraction : Extract the CDD feature set by running  `Generate_CDD.py` in  folder  `Feature_sets_extraction` , extract the BCP feature set and SICP feature set by running `Generate_BCPandSICP.py`,  normalize the BCP feature set generated by `Generate_BCPandSICP.py` by running `Nor_BCP.py`. The above functions can be accomplished by implementing the following command line codes in order:
```
python .\Feature_sets_extraction\Generate_CDD.py  
```
```
python .\Feature_sets_extraction\Generate_BCPandSICP.py  
```
```
python .\Feature_sets_extraction\Nor_BCP.py
```
3. Construct_fusion_model : Build the fusion prediction model and determine some properties and hyperparameters of the depth model by running the `feature_BCP_SBCP_CDP.py` file in the `Construct_fusion_model/construct_model` folder. The above function is accomplished by implementing the following command line codes in order:
```
python .\Construct_fusion_model\construct_model\feature_BCP_SBCP_CDP.py
```

4. Test_fusion_model: Test the fusion prediction model built in the previous step by running the `feature_BCP_SBCP_CDP_testModel.py` file in the `Construct_fusion_model/test_model` folder.
```
python .\Construct_fusion_model\test_model\feature_BCP_SBCP_CDP_testModel.py
```
5. Construct_CDD_model : Build the CDD single feature set prediction model and determine some properties and hyperparameters of the depth model by running the `feature_CDD.py` file in the `CDD/construct_model` folder.
```
python .\CDD\construct_model\feature_CDD.py
```

6. Test_CDD_model: Test the CDD single feature set prediction model built in the previous step by running the `feature_CDD_testModel.py` file in the `CDD/test_model` folder.
```
python .\CDD\test_model\feature_CDD_testModel.py
```

7. Construct_BCP_model : Build the BCP single feature set prediction model and determine some properties and hyperparameters of the depth model by running the `feature_BCP.py` file in the `BCP/construct_model` folder.
```
python .\BCP\construct_model\feature_BCP.py
```

8. Test_BCP_model: Test the BCP single feature set prediction model built in the previous step by running the `feature_BCP_testModel.py` file in the `BCP/test_model` folder.
```
python .\BCP\test_model\feature_BCP_testModel.py
```

9. Construct_SICP_model : Build the SICP single feature set prediction model and determine some properties and hyperparameters of the depth model by running the `feature_SICP.py` file in the `SICP/construct_model` folder.
```
python .\SICP\construct_model\feature_SICP.py
```

10. Test_SICP_model: Test the SICP single feature set prediction model built in the previous step by running the `feature_SICP_testModel.py` file in the `SICP/test_model` folder.
