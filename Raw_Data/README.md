### Introduction of the dataset：

The single-cell Hi-C data used in this study were downloaded from https://github.com/tanaylab/schic2 from the study by Nagano et al. They employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to label the cycle of 1171 mouse embryonic stem cells and capture Hi-C data of these cells. The cell cycles of these mouse embryonic stem cells are as follows: There are 280 cells in the G1 phase, 303 cells in the early-S phase (early-S), 262 cells are in the mid-S phase (mid-S), and 326 cells are in the Late-S or G2 stage (late-S/G2). The downloaded raw data files include chromatin interaction pair files and read pair locus mapping files. The chromatin interaction pair file involves information such as the sequence numbers of the chromatin fragment pairs and the count of interactions. The read pair locus mapping file contains the relationship between the chromatin fragment sequence number, chromatin information, and precise position information.
